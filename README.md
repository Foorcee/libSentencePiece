# libSentencePiece

This library provides a C-compatible wrapper around SentencePiece, allowing integration with C# via P/Invoke.

### Usage
Ensure the library is built in Release mode to avoid compatibility issues with C#.


### Note: 
The C# wrapper for libSentencePiece can be found under [SentencePiece.NET](https://github.com/Foorcee/SentencePiece.NET).
